# Smart Home Automation System  

This project is a **smart home automation system** using **ESP32** and **Blynk** for remote monitoring and control. It integrates **sensors, servomotors, and real-time alerts** to enhance security and automation.  

## Features  
- ESP32-based control with Wi-Fi connectivity  
- Blynk app integration for remote monitoring  
- Sensor-driven automation (e.g., motion, temperature)  
- Servomotor control for door or appliance automation  
- Real-time alerts for security notifications  

## Setup  
1. Program ESP32 using **Arduino IDE**  
2. Connect sensors and actuators as per the circuit diagram  
3. Use Blynk for remote access and automation  

## Included Files  
- Source code for ESP32  
- Circuit diagrams for hardware setup  
- Setup instructions for deployment  

This project ensures scalability, reliability, and ease of use for smart home applications.
