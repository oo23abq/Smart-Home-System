Smart Home Automation System
This project is a smart home automation system using ESP32 and Blynk for remote monitoring and control. It integrates sensors, servomotors, and real-time alerts to enhance security and automation.

Features
ESP32-based control with Wi-Fi connectivity
Blynk app integration for remote monitoring
Sensor-driven automation (e.g., motion, temperature)
Servomotor control for door or appliance automation
Real-time alerts for security notifications
Setup
Program ESP32 using Arduino IDE
Connect sensors and actuators as per the circuit diagram
Use Blynk for remote access and automation
This repository includes code, circuit diagrams, and setup instructions for easy deployment and scalability.
